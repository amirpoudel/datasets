Been here many times Nice place to be Service is good but sometimes slow Here are the things we tried and the review Nachos Just Ok
Great food service and atmosphere We had chicken thakali set Everything alright You need to experience Jimbus service once to make sure you didnt miss at least
Love this place really enjoyed their food tasty food with the reasonable price One of the best places in Kathmandu Nepal
Ive heard a lot about JimBu and finally I got the opportunity to visit the place Its overcrowded and the management team needs to work harder to manage things better This isnt worth the expenses we incurred here
Very crowded even on weekdays even after in evening very lively proof that Nepalese are not poor and they do have night life Famous for its family dining they definitely serve good thakali cuisine
I recently dined here and it was a mixed experience The food was good but it didnt quite reach the level of very good that I was hoping for The flavors were decent and the presentation was appealing but there was a certain spark
The food is normally on Time but when big group comes you have to wait a little bit Many delicious options from burgers to fine Thakali sets The rooms get quite hot nowadays The waiters do their best to help Always a nice experience if you dont mind waiting a bit for food
Great Ambience Had to wait hours for food The Chicken Thali set was just average salty
Loved this place This place is not targeted to tourists or the affluent but is best described as a restaurant that locals would frequent for a good hearty meal with quality food
Today we have very weird service happen in jimbu normally it wouldnt happen but we just need asks for more than average for water and the lady we got for serve she is not from hospitality sector If somebody asks for normal water you should give them Overall food is always same
It was an excellent Restaurant in the heart of Kathmandu As its a famous supper restaurant so I wish they had expanded the childrens area into a more significant place or room which forced me to deduct one star The rest was fantastic such as the Food atmosphere tradition staff member and location
I like the place but the food is standard people say its the best but to my taste pallet it was nothing special The parking space is good and the biggest advantage is its location which is very central The staff are friendly and the over all service is good
Ive heard a lot about their mutton momos so I decided to come and dine in here I ordered mutton momos green veg salad and a cappuccino The mutton momos lived up to the expectations no doubt on that But what disappointed me was the
Went with family and had mutton set and veg sets It was crowded cuz of Saturday and food was awesome but we asked for extra rice and all like we got some and later they forget whenever we asked later Due to over busy and Saturday I think
Food was just ok Security Guard Ganesh was helpful and very welcoming Both indoor and out sitting available small children can enjoy playground outsidetks
Within my time in Kathmandu we came here times and each time was as good as the last Mutton Thali set is flavourful and they give you many refills Would recommend to anyone
First time eating here was definitely a good food and day second time food was not okay they didnt even pour their speciality which is ghee chicken wasnt that tasty overall not a vibe that was like last year
From the heart of Balwatar Jimbu Thakali serves as a sanctuary for those in pursuit of traditional Nepalese flavors As a party of five we embarked on a culinary journey opting for the Chicken Mutton and Fish Thali each dish embodying
Known for their Thakali khana set which is pretty goodI love their signature burger must try if you love burgers Recently they added dessertsChimichangas Cheese Cake is really goodCheese Cake with a twist
Thakali dish was good But service was slowThis place is famous for fine dining and thakali food Service portions are also good But no of service staff is less with respect to guests Various non veg and veg snacks options are also
Food is bang average here For a place specializing in Thakali food Thakali set is the one I would avoid here Please skip their gourmet momos and also their jhol momos Only food we liked was Chicken Picatta but the portion size was
Jimbu Thakali Restaurant is excellent I really enjoyed the food and the staff was incredibly kind The service was also very nice and I appreciated the polite attitude of the staff The restaurant was spotless making the whole
Want a lovely dining experience A must visit delicious food and superb service from the staff
We liked the ambiance of the restaurant Food was good but on the milder side I was expecting more of a Thakali taste but the food tasted more on the western side spice wise Staff were attentive and the second helpings came without asking Definitely a good place to visit for a tasty lunchdinner
Excellent service The food and the portions are both amazing and with a very lovely vibe Special shoutout to LOK BAHADUR TAMANG Very nice personality and very friendly
Nepali Thali set is one of my favorites here at Jimbu However other food like momo nachos etc can be better Veg thali is my favourite Churros for desert was quite alright too
One of the most authentic and so far the most delicious Nepalese food I have tried in Kathmandu Will come back here again while I am here Must try We have ordered mutton momo and stuffed egg plants and chicken thakali set Everything was extremely delicious
Amazing place to eat an authentic thakali The service is fantastic come see Rajesh and the ambiance is great
The taste of starters were amazing We had mutton momo buckwheat chips and mushroom I think main course could taste better
This spot is a popular goto for enjoying a Thakali rice set and the food quality is excellent The gundruk achar is particularly noteworthy and really stands out Although I dont typically eat rice Ive tried some of the vegetable
With my previous experience of delicious food I loved to come here but this time it was a total disappointment where the food thakalai khana maccha was spotted with human hair also fish was as per my palte salty which made my
Food was really good and service was excellent from Roshan rai atmosphere was waaaaoo amazing thank you so much we will came again love it
Ive heard a lot about JimBu and finally got the opportunity to visit the place Food is not upto the mark as expected Fish gravy in khana set was horrible Can taste only sour n Timmur flavor This isnt worth the expenses we incurred
Those who want to Taste Nepalese Food for the first time would be best choice According to price to taste is very reliable Being vegetarian love to be little more portion of paneer curry Service is good Highly recommended
Higher pointsstars for the atmosphere and service Good is just ok
thank you for giving the excellent service and food was really good I came with family and i am really satisfied with the way we got treated A star service from Geeta and team absolutely lovable We will come again for delicious food
We ate here two nights in a row because we liked it that much It was packed both nights Their stuffed chicken wings were simply amazing They went great with the Sherpa Red craft beer they have on tap
Jimbu Thakali is a true gem for anyone looking to experience authentic Thakali Khana
Really good food and hospitable staffs
Food was quite good but little bit more oily and we had to wait until for Khana I hope you guys can change time am samma
One of the worst thakali I visited in recent times I visited jimbu thakali with high hopes but was totally disappointment with the services and waiter were not attentive i had to wait for curry for min after there is rice in plate and i
One of my favourite places for Thakali food Never been disappointed by the food and service here The ambiance is always great here Ive almost tasted all the curries in Jimbu and absolutely love them except the fish curry which for some
Beautiful decor and ambiance for sure I was on a trip to Kathmandu after many years All I did try go to good restaurants and I find this was on the best I ever had I wish I tried their thakali cuisine had timur chicken had to order
Average food for high price Place was heavily crowded with people waiting for sitting spaces Staff have poor hospitality once you are seated No one asked us for anything until we called the staff for the order Staff expected us to leave assoon we were done eating Not worth your pay
Very nice food We tried the Spaghetti Bolognaise which I would give a The pasta was tangy and flavourful We tried the Captain Grills Chicken Burger and that was really really good I would give this a aswell as it was a bit too
Lovely environment wonderful food top notched service by their staff called KRITI She was amazing Love this place
We order different types of food For me I cant eat much so only mutton while others ordered special thali i forgot exact name The yoghurt and lalmon was delicious Mutton was delicious everything was For me dal was different
This place is becoming a highway hotel from one of the best Thakali place Please maintain the quality and the service i knew in the past
Always have been fond of Thakali Food and Jimbu Thakali Tangal always exceeds expectations Kudos to the friendly team members Bikash has been very lovely during our times in Jimbu
Worst experience ever also is worst among its branches Never visitng again Thakali fod is exepensive but thats ok The problem was no one asked us if we would like to add anything thap khana even once When I asked them for more
Loved the thakali food Staffs were very courteous and attentive
Too much famous for such a place good food i had to stay in waiting area cause it wall full pack although it was large enough space i had to wait overall expectations and experiences were good
Jimbu Thakali offers a diverse menu that includes traditional Thakali cuisine as well as modern dishes and drinks The food is delicious the service is excellent and the ambiance is pleasant although the restaurant tends to be busy Additionally the restaurant provides ample parking facilities
It is always a nice experience to have dinner at Jimbu I have been there with both small and large groups It is always corwded whenever I visit probably due to the fact that this place is always filled with food lovers I always book a

One of the best thakali in Kathmandu Mouthwatering thakali dinner set with traditional mutton meat And ofcourse the fresh fruit punch completed the whole dinner Thank you Mr Biskah for the warm hospitality
Food is okay Not as I expected after read lot of reviews Too pricy Service was good Friendly staff Food need to improve a lot And must be reasonable price
Food is good Nice ambience However this place is always crowded You have to wait sometime to get a sitting place If you are visiting with groups suggest to book a table in advance
Yet an another Thakali cuisine which I tried during my Kathmandu visit Even this restaurant has its own taste of serving the traditional newari cuisine
The snacks are as good as the thali but the best thing about Jimbu is efficient service Ample parking space private and general tables childrens minipark clean bathroom Everything is worth the tad expensive money
i went alone so they ignored me and i insisted that i sit by the bar in high chair and eat the thakali set Very unprofessional Had different experience when i went their with group but this kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable
The food is out of becoz i cannot find so testyThe place is very elegant vibes are amazing and staff are very friendlyspecially Rajesh
One of the best places for thakali food in Kathmandu Comfortably in the top The place is very nice clean and well maintained The service is also very good and timely Would definitely recommend
Not worth the money Desert served was not freshly prepared couple of days left over Disappointing
Visited here for lunch and was just left waiting for a long time It turned out the servers had forgotten to place the orders correctly Once that was fixed the food arrived quickly Had to wait over minutes for the food
How anyone rated this place highly is beyond comprehension slow service poor tasting food and bad vibes all around chicken and gravy were two separately prepared and mixed together forcibly Daal was equally poor even the fried potato sucked balls Kathmanduites need to find a better alternative for a proper thakali meal
Nice atmosphere but taste average these days many thakali offer higher quality than jimbu so jimbu needs ti improve now
Last night the three of us went to Jimbu Thakali For starters we ordered chicken satte and wings choila which were fantastic Unfortunately the drinks I ordered margarita and cucumber martini were a disaster As our main course we
They have lost their authenticity The name thakali doesnt do justice for the food they serve No quality food especially vegetables
Overall its nice place for lunch and dinner Food is okay not great Its is better to have reservation otherwise you have to until the table is
A go to place for thakali khana set with friends and family The ambiance is nice and also have small playground for children The staffs are polite and humble As the place is kind of crowded so you have to expect some delay in getting the food
Foods are tastythe service was very fastone of the best of its kind in nepal
Feels very good to be here You can just enjoy the environment ambiance food services they provide and just enjoy your time over here where you can get best thakali food in the town
I have always been a fan of chicken club sandwich and will continue to have it in future But I was disappointed with the sandwich I got yesterday chicken with soft bones in one of the four pieces Please make sure of the things you put in the great food
Delicious food with reasonable price Quick service Hospitable staffs
Expensive but not so special i got drink with strawberry and they put strawberries jam in the drink instead of fresh strawberries very disappointing
As usual a very authentic and reasonable place for thakalinepali thali The vibe was love on th feb service was quick and good Food was great
Tasty food and friendly staff Thanks to Shalom Januka and Ashok for making our dining experience wonderful Will visit again soon
Jimbu is one of the nicer Thakali joints in Kathmandu Limited choices but the food is really good Both veg and chicken options are good Ample parking is available beer options are also write good
Great food Special Thakali Thali was delicious Beer and hard drinks also available Also group parties and birthday parties available Sitting both inside and outside Big TV screen inside
Good Food Good Taste Polite Staffs must try their Chelijwai Thali I just loved it
Best for Kathmandu local food
Orderd local chicken sets on new year got different meals without proper communication After that waiter dissapered And cashier said it that it was their mistake but charged for meals It was my first time with jimbu thakali and worst experience I would not recommend any to visit them
Had a great time here The service was really smooth and the people here were also really sweet
In service there was a girl named Smita She was nice polite friendly and served us very well Most of the time we go to Jimbu Thakali we always have a great time
Not as expected as name very very pricy not worth the price additional top up rice was far different than the first one Fish curry with Dal Bhat That was not even a curry
Food and service was great Would like to recommend thali here Service was topnotch
Thikaii naii thiyo testo wow khalko thau pani haina I would rather prefer Local thakali just few blocks down towards the laxmi sunrise bank gairidhara I mean the foods are quite average not wow Thakali and apart from that the place is
The environment was good but a bit crowded The food was spicy hot and tasted average Despite my hunger I could not eat much because of the chili in everything The food was way overpriced Ive had thakali set tasting way better for lesser price
Overall food and service was great And thanks to Reeya for being polite and welcoming to us
Good service proper management and good food Great interior and those transparent seperators for social distancing makes us want to go their even in these covid situation
The pace was very nice including the ambience too Food was Definitely recommend for both family and friends
Jimbu Thakali A Traditional Thakali Restaurant in Kathmandu Jimbu Thakali is a traditional Thakali restaurant in Kathmandu named after
The thakali khana was a delectable feast that showcased a delightful variety of flavors in one plate
Nice place for Authentic Thakali The Thakali sets they serve are very rich in flavor Pricing is a bit high compared to other places that serve Thakali Set
Jimbu Thakali might look overrated because of their quick success and social media hypes but after dining here I can say that they serve one of the best quality thakali khana set meal in Kathmandu
All good except they need to work harder on food quality And I dont understand why all Nepali restaurants bathrooms are so stinky and dirty
Nepali Thali Set is good I had veg nepali Thali set Parking space available Small kikds space Indoor bar is also nice Food qualit avrage Toilet smell very bad Plz keep adjust fan Overallgood place for nepali thali Next time i order home pack was also nice dal bhat set
Food was good But had a bad experience with service I asked for the tomato pickle and the way that staff served me was very rude Even when I said clearly to give little amount she gave me whole spoonful of pickle which I found to be very rude After the way she served I couldnt eat more
The level of service is going down Servers are not attentive as well Any other food items except nepali thali needs vast improvement
The best dish was grilled chicken Loved it Good restaurant with delicious food Its good that the place got children play area You guys could improve a bit in customer service
This is The best Place to have Thakali khanaa and they also Have a playground in which the kids can enjoyThey Serve Finger licking Good foodThey serve Very Nice and Super FastT
Staff are good and service is ourstanding Shalon is a servie man He is very good server please try his servie As well as anusha is a good cashier
Very good food and ambience I would highly recommend Great host kirti g
Bikash is great person out for all the service Great Food as always
Person thali and vegetable thali along with some snacks and drinks is what we order But the thali was ok and did not meet the expectation as of thakali khana
The food is quite good Overally best place to hangout with friends and family
Mr Shalom was very humble and provided very good service The food was good and the ambience great Thank you jimbu
Best experience while celebrating teej Love the food environment ambience
This branch of Jimbu is the best amongst all other Jimbus I like food here The only thing I hate is the wait time
The appearance is so good and the food is absolutely amazing please visit if you are in kathmandu vally
The atomsphere was really good along with the service and service staff
Authentic Nepali food good taste Good staffs But washroom was messy
Great taste Great food One of the must have experience with family for a quality and best taste Thakali experience Has lately become quite expensive maybe due the price hikes but still very worthful
Descent place for the vegetarians like me but id you are the fan of thakali food and barbecue then this is the place you would like to check out
Great ambience decent food high pricing decent service always crowded Update rs for a bottle of water is not acceptable
By far the best thakali in kathmandu i would rate it but everytime i am there the daal tastes little off and the service is good
Very nice place to be with family or friends Great food and great ambience Staffs are really polite and the place is overall very nice
Nice ambience with very good mutton thakali food Really recommendable
Sitting arrangements could have been better space is tight and kinda hot Otherwise the service is good and hospitable
Service was amazing Good food everbest thakali
Food is goodspaghetti Bolognese is awesome Nepali Thali set is also okayand the chicken jhol momo is yummy tangy tasty But the staffs are not friendly the lady waitress is unpleasant and the replies
I had sweet corn today portion was very poor but price is for one plate but was very few Do not recommend to all
While the food was excellent the experience didnt quite live up to the hype Unfortunately they didnt have spare vegetables to complete the meal requiring a separate purchase For vegetarians it may not be the best decision to dine there due to this limitation
Varieties of food for Veg Set as well I love it everything was delicious
Nice place many options for food Big space families oy friendly There is a child chair The maintenance of the space is ok A bit dasty in the court yard Despite the existence of the play ground not possible to use very dusty
Had great food and great time
Not as good as before Quality is slowly going down The potatoes which used to be so tasty was hard and tasteless The papad was so oily not fried properly had to ask for another Dal gundruk achar mula achar was great
We were party of and had thali However the Goat meat was a total rip off It came out but wasnt too hot enough and had barely any meat on it and way too tough to eat I would recommend the trout fish though
Food taste Food options Hygiene Service Price mostly worth the food they serve
Its was very delightful attractive presentation of thakali set Tasty thakali experience Januka s service was very nice
The meal and service were both prompt and delectable I highly recommend it
All good food is delicious service is also good kirti is nice waitress
Was expecting a bit more based on all the reviews the thakali set was good but I couldnt justify the price of it Taste and ambience is good
Its good to eat sometime at jimbu but not regularly
Food was delicious fantastic service Highly recommended Sholom was amazing
Good food great taste The place is popular among people so it is crowded and the staff takes the great responsibility to manage customers
The service was incredibly slow I waited for over an hour just for the Thakali set While the Thali was satisfactory however enjoyed their mutton momo The staff seemed busy but their hospitality was lacking Hope they learn and improve their communication with customers
overrated Food average of expectation More spicy than usual thakali taste No Gundruk
Very good food Staff are very friendly
If you want to eat normal Nepal dal bhat with a crowded ambience best place If you want to eat authentic thakali khana set not so great place
It was my first time at a thakali place in Nepal The food was awesome You need to get there a little before you are hungry cos you might have to wait a bit to get a table as this is a very popular food joint and its always filled with
We were there week ago the food they served was the worst food I have ever eaten in my whole life We had ordered Chicken thakali and they served Dip fry Cauliflowers with no salt and nthg next
I had the special Thakali Everything tasted good except the mutton It felt undercooked The staff is very courteous and helpful They ensure the next round is served and you are comfortable
Good place Expensive but worth the service and fine dining Its a great place for family gatherings
A wonderful place to dine Loved the service and the food served
Very good for family dining and service is very fast thank you so much
We were served food even after pm The staff were really helpful They managed to serve the food for people even at the last minute They do have a free parking lot But the food taste is average and has degraded more than before
Ordered cream stuffed chicken It was good a bit on the salty side though Parking space is good
Excellent food good ambience friendly staff fast servive
They dont serve food like before Tasteless chicken and fish gravy Tasteless vegetables It was one my favorite place to go But from yesterday no more Will go other better thakali places than spending here
Great ambience with good food and grown staffs
Good but I would not say it is like what others say about it in their review I ate vegetarian food and it was ok good nothing special I ate in a small Thakali restaurant in Gongabu Town planning near my home run by a family I think the food was better there
Nice place Food is very expensive We can enjoy of two people at other restaurant for price of one of Jimbu Thakali Mutton Khana price is NPR for one person
Very tasty food and good hookah View is amazing
Beautiful place lovely food and staff
Too Crowded You can find better thakali food in other places
Jimbu Thakali offers a delightful culinary journey right in the heart of Kathmandu The veg thakali is delicious and the kanchambari buckwheat fritters adds a refreshing crunch to the meal With its widespread availability and
There was no word to explain about the service and staff were missing around waited for more than minutes for thakali khana
The place is very crowded and we had to wait for almost minutes to get a table for four The food is good but can be improved The ambience is nice but the cleanliness is not up to the mark
The food was really good and service was great

Subtle and delicious
Its a pretty good restaurant
went to this place after a couple of years they have ample variety in their menu i am highly disappointed this time potatooes were undercooked pizza was made out of readymade dough sausages were dry and soggy my another problem is with the hukka and smoking in the place makes it uneasy for a family meal they should separate the smoking and non smoking zone they have gone with Money Heist decoration which i said would be outdated in a few months is the hype still there but the main point is the food which was bad and would not return here again
went to this place after a couple of years they have ample variety in their menu i am highly disappointed this time potatoe cheese balls were undercooked and felt like it was cooked from frozen food and chicken sizzler were dry and soggy but the main point is the food which was bad and would not return here again
Chicken biryani and Rice bowl used to be my favourite dishes with the chicken being soft in Biryani and the jeera rice very flavourful But the recent visit disappointed me alot They gave me chicken curry hidden inside the biryani rice and the same rice was used in Rice bowl with barely any flavours in the sauce Service was good but the food
had very nice experience The look of the restaurant and the service of the staff was the first thing that impressed me But after testing the delicious mouthwatering food I felt like it
The food quality is terrible Not sure how its prepared or what ingredients theyre using but my stomach has been upset since I last ate here
The roll is not good as expected and the burger was average interms of taste overall its pretty below average
I usually go this branch of chicken station when i have work around Kuleshwor area This branch of chicken station is Clean and also their food tastes great their service is fast we dont have to wait long for our food which is what i
had the chicken it was good staff friendly but toilet seat broken in ladies n got bitten by mosquitoes while eating and its not yet monsoon
Chicken Station Kuleshwor offers a cozy ambiance exceptional service and deliciously crafted dishes An unforgettable dining experiencehighly recommended
I have never seen this type of resturant the ambiance the food and the fast services
Worst place long waiting time to get food I order butterchicken they bring gravy chicken
Good place for hangout with perfect foods and service
Worst food experience ever Ordered a crunchy chicken burger and then they delivered me a burger with a huge crunchy chicken bone inside What is this Thees station
Very cozy and the service is amazing The employees are so friendly and the food there is excellent Love it
bad service i got served the wrong order and when i informed the staff about it they ignored and later when i asked again one of the waiters rudely said tei order gareko
The place is good and decent to go out to eat and chit chat however there is lack of taste in food Under that price it is not appealing to go and have a taste of an average food Hoping they can work on their taste like it used to be
Good food good ambience good service and parking available
Not Recommended Ordered the food on call Chicken Chilly with full Red color with worst color
Chopsuey was good Reasonable price not a fan of chicken here
Best chicken sekuwa i ever have
Best place for relaxation with good food
They provide good food but the service takes longer
How can a food be so disgusting made by a well known foodchain The worst branch of Chicken Station I would not recommend this place to anyone Ambience is good but the quality of food and hospitality is worst in this Kuleshwor Branch
We order grilled chicken burger but that was just like normal burger and price was only higher
Rude staff with ego They thik they are king of kuleshwor Food was ok but rude and unprofessional peoples run the place
I have been to chicken station at ravi bhawan Foods were not fresh beside staffs behave was not good Even they were not ready to provide wifi password So bad behaviour Never gonna go that place
Worst branch of the restaurant chain The worst tasting food out of all the outlets and even worse service The waiters are very unprofessional and rude
Bad service oversmart staffs and disgusting food ever worst branch Kuleshwor chicken station
Had a worst cheesy wings
I love katti roll here
Poor food hygiene despite clean ambience Found hair strands everywhere in food and cutlery I mean what are the odds that you get hair strands and eye lash in your drink food as well as in cutlery basket
Ambiance is one of the best Service is good But you will feel sorry if you take your four wheel to visit this place
Curry was so salty it ruined the whole dish

Khani kura mitho nai chaina
Buff C Momo was great the fried aloo stick had a thikthak taste and the fried mushroom was very crunchy and delicious to have and a bit oily as well But the food taste was very yum The price is also reasonable as per the food
If you like COCKROACHES everywhere on your table or on the walls just beside your momo this is the best place to eat
I recently had the pleasure of dining at NPP Food Service and I must say it was a delightful experience This hidden gem offers an array of delicious stick foods and other variants that left my taste buds dancing with joy
A great stick food joint if youre around this area Prices are reasonable and eating here with a group keeps you within a set budget of your choice I personally spend around Rs every time I am here with friends Sometimes the space can be an issue because of its size as well as its popularity
Absolute Disaster The jhol Buff MoMo I ordered was outright bad The jhol was tasteless and oddly thick The MoMo had a thick outer layer of the maida and the meat inside was
Has been my favorite place for stick food to go to with my school friends since our school days Our favorites have always been the buff sausages and hamburgers The cmomo used to be great during but it isnt as good anymore
its a great place for stick food and other fried food but nothing else dont go for their burgers or sandwiches or momos or chowmeins especially not pizzas they are all mediocre when you are in a hurry and craving for some spices this is the place to go
This is one of the most overrated place The food was not good at all I ordered chicken fried rice only to find small pieces of chicken in the plate During other occasions I have tried momo which was not properly cooked and the sausage looked like dried in the sun for days The place is also unhygienic and the service is below par
NPP is always the best choice for snacks They provide the perfect food I loved Momo and Sausage The achar was perfect The only think I didnt like about the place was the price of drumstick which was Rs for small piece Overall the
An easily accessible and affordable fast food eatery of Lalitpur Have been coming here for ages Personal favourites sausages and thukpa
Different kind of fried CMomoamong the best cmomos that Ive tastedsausage and aloo were decentchowmein however was below parParking for two wheelers would be on the roadfor wheelers there might be some problem Update French fries is probably the worst dish here Also found ketchup to be very stale
Good and best budget food in town Dont forget to try stick foods sausage tofu mushroom and potato stick are speciality of this restaurant
The worst stick food Ive ever had in my entire life It was so bad and the service was also very poor They even served us wrong orders Overall experience was a total disaster
Cockroach in Momo I do not recommend this place There are lots of option nearby
A decent place opposite to Sumeru Hospital PulchowkDamkal for a small to medium gathering Good food you should try their momo and achar is sooo good
Best place for fast food and the service is also faster comparatively
The Momo tasted bland and achar was thick and lacked proper spices The sausage on the other hand were delicious
Food is quiet inexpensive but average taste However it is easy to grab some of your friends and make this one of your gang aadda
The food was good It wasnt something unique nor was it bad It was good There are better options in that area to get a good nice dine It simply cant keep up the competition And Its better to take out because the hygiene there is bad I saw cockroaches walking on the table wall and insects there
The Beautiful Spring near Santaneshwor Temple says The Heaven Fall Below Bhattarai Niwas Badegoun Jhurashi Godawari Municipality
Relatively pretty good restaurant Service is satisfactory and food are delicious
Cheese was not that good though chips chilly and aloo stick is must try thing here Service was also good
Here you will find the greatest stick foods We tried mushroom sticks pork balls and sausages and each one was outstanding The sauce on the other hand was much better You can get the best meal for a low price and you wont have to
It was the worst experience of my life We ordered veg jhol momo and the vegetable inside momo stalebasi and the taste of jhol was also so bad When we complaint the staff too showed rude behavior and all of them were manner less I dont recommend anyone to go there
The service is fast The stick foods are delicious The momo is also good The uniqueness about this place is the taste of the sauce they provide which is different from all other places However the quality of the food here is degrading which makes me sad as this used to be my most visited places to have lunch during my college life
not good foodbad customers care Too much salty food i asked to change the order that was salty but they dnt
Very old place serving stick foods at affordable price
Great place for verities of snacks in reasonable price Loved the place
Not good foods
Horrible Experience Went to the pulchowk branch of NPP and took my friends along too It was the most disgusting experience ever in Nepal We decided to sit in one of the tables but saw a baby cockroach crawling on the seat so we went to
Its actually not good Water bottles plates sauce containers very bad Maybe the price will justify it but still no reason to play with customers hygiene Sticks food were tasty but didnt find any taste no chicken momo Personally wont visit ever folks looking for a quick cheap bite can have a go
NPP used to be my goto place when in college since they offer inexpensive ready to serve stickfood Really cheap but equally delicious Their sausages Momo fries drumsticks are all full of flavor and spicy NPP is probably the finest inexpensive yet great food serving place
This place used to be so good But now the food is outright horrible Youll probably end up with a bad stomach
NPP is one of the best stick food places in Lalipur Compared to other outlets the pulchowk one is better in service and food Being a vegetarian I often find myself there for their mushroom stick This place is budget friendly as well
Place is cheap and good for fast food but the service is worst plate was dirty no napkins on the table empty water bottles achar was also not fresh there was watery layer on top please provide heigneic environment even if the place is cheap
YUKK THE WORST NOT RECOMMENDED AT ANY COST DOESNT EVEN DESERVE STAR
Worst decision to choose this resturant in mid of Pulchowk The taste of food specially momo and burger is not so good Taste and achar seems like the street food thela walaThe stick food are normal in taste dont expect daami taste
Literally had to wait an hour for momos and the server totally forgot our side meat balls and tofu The server keeps saying dai huna lai sakyo when i asked to cancel the ordee
Good for stick food but atmosphere and service could be better
Less than stellar sitting area without AC and can get very hot during the summer Pricing is affordable with range of items and is popular for stick foods Taste is mediocre however the momo sauce is quite unique with rich consistency
Perfect place for stick foods and all
Great food at great prices Has extremely quick service The food here is quite mouth watering mainly the stick food However the quality of the sauce has been declining Great place if you want quick food
Just a basic eatery cheap and opens until late night Stick food is OK however hygiene might be a concern mostly during summer
Its alright I go here sometimes The food is great sometimes but one time I got burned potatoes I was not that happy with the service because they forgot to bring my coke I have been here a few times Used to be way better years back
Small place I loved MOMO buff had tofu but the size of tofu was enormously small Budget friendly visit to snack on
Dont know what was wrong with my food but everything I ordered came fast but the taste was horribleI didnt like jhol Momos jhol and momo as well for the first time in my life the buff chowmein that I ordered had exactly pieces of buff and chowmein seemed to be stalebasi the Alo stick and mushroom stick was average
Visited today at NPP after lockdown foods that we ordered were disaster Mainly the manchurian it was uncooked The c momo was also way too sweet Had a horrible experience When talk about the same to the concerned people they denied to take our feedback Very rude nature Now i am not going again to this latitpur store for sure
Have been vising here since years and the food quality has not changed the price is also reasonable Must visit place if you are a stick food fan
This was the goto spot some years ago because it has been here for ages The resturants were few back in time The stick food stalls were very few back in time So it was Ideal
Meatballs were like styrofoam Unhygeinic
Not a nice place for eating Even though affordable and cheap price but the quality of food was below average The place was also not cleaned and it was unhygenic
Food was good but not as expected as shown in youtubes and various other platforms But not bad you can try once and give judgement My judgement is based on the comparison between the food same alike which I eat
Fast and fried food around Damkal chowk is your crave Step in here Clean place and quick service Unfortunately its a cash only place I wonder if they have now started Fonepay
One of the best local restaurants around Sumeru city hospital Lots of choices for fast food and quick servicing On the flip side of being famous it usually gets crowded with the customers Good Restaurant to eat while around the Damkalchowk area
Has lots of varieties for stick fast food Tried chowmein but was not upto the taste Service was ok though it took bit longer than usual Not that great place for lunch Price seem ok and affordable Not so recommended
Worst food quality
Loved the dishes specially Momo its very nice one Small place but enjoyed it
The best thing about NPP is the sauce Mix the spicy and the non spicy one and every dull item becomes tasty Food is good But the taste seems to be degrading
I was there to order food Saw sausages being made and then served The sausages fell down on the floor and the lady picked it up and served the same sausages to the customer Disgusting They dont even care
Sausages were quite good Else average
Good for a quick bite dose not serve tea
If you are an indian then I like to stop you from going there Because I had my first meal in Nepal in NPP The chicken was raw sabji was tasteless If you are nepali then its fine
The food here is very cheap and tasty too The staffs were very friendly I had fun while eating here
Do not recommend to order the drumsticks The drumsticks were very small
Good Food for the price
A decent place for fast food The service and the foods quality is great too Recommended
Good for food and very affordable

Fast food for fast people Affordable price with good service Fried Mushroom and momo was best
This place serves various types of stick food at moderate price and chow mein is one of the best item of this place

Delicious and charming spot The staff was so nice I took my friend here to try traditional Nepali food and we were not disappointed It was so packed because this place is a local favorite Highly recommend going
The Thakali food was to the point like Thakali home cooked meal The goat meat curry was delicious the black kidney beans tasted like moms Mustang potatoes was the bomb
I had a Saturday lunch with a friend the first weekend of August The establishment was very busy but we were seated promptly and served quickly The Chicken set was excellent and second portions were offered generously We lingered after
I may fall under minority when I say this but personally I didnt like this place much I went there with a friend to have proper thakali meal but their serving time
Mantra Thakali in Jhamsikhel Lalitpur is a popular restaurant known for its authentic Thakali cuisine It offers a variety of traditional Nepali dishes including highly praised Thakali sets mutton momos and spicy chicken wings The
I was expecting more Kalo Dal lentil soup
The food at Mantra Thakali Restaurant was undeniably delicious with flavors that tantalized the taste buds However it leaned towards being a bit oily which might not suit everyones preference Also it lack that gundruk ko achar
Food is authentic and has original taste Fast service Crowded during lunchtime Some staffs need training for foodservings without spilling
Overrated and awful awful service I understand if the place is popular and the staff might have difficulty in
The place is nice and the ambiance is great but I dont know why people are hyped about the food here The food is good and clean but taste wise I just feel its okayish May be just my taste palate
Welcoming atmosphere The manager was really polite friendly and helpful The staff were nice too The food tasted amazing the rice they use is really good Ghee was not up to the mark though Everything else was delicious
I was not aware of this lovely restaurant Walking in the night and looking for a place to have our dinner we walked in here The place was almost full on a weekday Keeping the culture of Kathmandu
I had a really great experience here The food was amazing along with great customer service Highly recommend for families and kids
I recommend everyone to come here and take best experience of food and service Good hospitality with testy food One of the best staff bigyan He is so kind and helpful
I visited here on a weekday for dinner The place is very clean and staff are friendly They attend to you immediately and also clean the tables instantly Enough parking space There is tables outside but we chose to sit inside Seating
Food is as good as before Daal and achar is top notch But it looks like they have an increased price
Place feels small compared to the number of people it attracts The food here is excellent even the ones outside of the usual Thakali Menu
The food was was good Serving time was quick However in such a lovely place there were no person to greet while entering and had to call waiter to get our orders
My favourite restaurant in Nepal Great food and nice place The only issue is it can be hard to get a seat some nights
I recently had the pleasure of dining at Mantra Thakali Restaurants and I must say it was an incredible experience From the moment I stepped in I was greeted with a warm and inviting ambiance that set the tone for a memorable meal
One of the best Thakali food Ive had in Kathmandu
Awesome thakali food Place is occupied most of the time Has good parking space Good atmosphere
The thali was amazing I loved there Mutton Curry Nice food good ambiance Recommended to go with friends and families They have space for parking in their compound
Mutton thali set is my favourite dish here and I must say that they have extra vegetables curry which is not added these days by other renowned Thakali restaurants
Food is just good kinda fusion modern thakali food It kinda lacks authenticity But I enjoyed lunch very much Spacious parking nice ambeince and food is served on time So I may be visiting again
Awesome Loved their services and the food offered was really good
I had heard a lot of good things about the place I went there on a Sunday at approximately pm and it was very crowded We had to wait about mins to be seated Once we were seated and ordered the food it came out pretty quick
Im just disappointed and i feel very sorry for the restaurant itself Ive been their customer for years now but the service is just plain rude and disrespectful every time i visit If the restaurant itself doesnt care about this then no
So they stop serving food after pm and we literally called them to confirm if we could come in mins late Travelled an hour and a half to come here and this guy Neeraj completely denied talking on call Waste of time tbh the food is really good the the employees need t fix their attitude honestly
nd Visit Fish Thali The gravy was just okay Rs is very expensive for a Thali
To our experience its an extremely overrated and unnecessarily hyped place It was extremely disappointing to wait for so long only to be disappointed with distasteful food
Came here in May Nice restaurant Amazing food As usual I ordered chicken gravy with rice It
Good service Ambient and food quality is also good I got recommended by someone and tried thakali Khana set mutton it was delicious Also they serve additional portion if required
Food is really good but a bit on the expensive side
Warm and friendly atmosphere quite spacious sitting arrangements Staffs are friendly Delicious thakali set good portion Gets very busy so its sometimes hard to find place to sit
Zero worth of money staff is now up to mark n trainined minutes of waiting and served only set out of and served lately Till they served remaining old were been cold n on requesting staff that please let these three start serve
Mantra Thakali provided me with an unforgettable eating experience The greatest Chicken Khana Set in town is served here The pork achar was delicious and brimming with flavor The exquisite balance of vegetables and Achar in the Khana

Food service is best Best place to have lunch and dinner with clean environment
A nice place to have a typical Nepali Thakali lunch good set delicious dal saag veggies achar and rice Clean and separate washrooms which is so very important during Covid times Loved the spacious parking area and the smart
Best Thakali Restaurant in ktm valley Ample parking for two wheeler and four wheeler I used to go there for Veg Thakali
One of the best Thakali restaurant in Kathmandu I always get the mutton khana set I love to combine the black lentils with the mutton gravy for that ultimate umami flavor You get unlimited servings The potatoes are also really good as
stars for excellent Thali Dal Bhat This place offers free refills so it is all you can eat Excellent location in the nicer area of Patan
My favorite thakali restaurant A must go place
This was my first ever Thakali food experience here at Mantra the experience was Loved the local NepaliThakali food and way of serving I had also tried Mint lemonade here which was okayish Staffs were polite well mannered Keep up the good work
Food is nice Texture of gravy is great and the dal is amazing But service is slow and some of the male staffs have a face filled with attitude They must be taught to be humble with customer Grooming is necessary
The food was good But I missed gundruk sadeko and did not like the pyaz thing and the golbeda ko achar also Dont get me wrong I love golbheda ko achar but this wasnt good Otherwise the thali was good
The Chicken thali set was quite good and the place had a nice vibe The staff were also quite friendly and helpful However if you are looking a quiet and calm place to eat Mantra may not be the best choice as its quite crowded and
Best authentic Nepali cuisine It was my first time in this place The service was fabulous and food was extra ordinary The cleanliness and beautiful decor is A I would love to come again and again and advice more than people to come
Been to this place with family and had a great time We all enjoyed meal and thank You to all the staff and specially Sanjok
Good ambience the Thakali set was good as well Enough space for parking both four abd two wheelers the staffs are cooperative Definately Recommended
Food is really good one of the best thakalis in the valley Recommend the Pork Achar which is their house special

Nice place to go for lunch Food here is flavorsome with friendly woking staffs
If you are going to Katmandu this is the place to try amazing food the service is amazing the way they serve and take care of you is superb pocket friendly and the unlimited system is nice Its a must visit place
The food here is not that good For a price that high I would much rather go to other thakali places and get my moneys worth Sorry but Mantra Thakali was a let down for me
I had a very phenomenal experience with Mantra Have to say that its best thakali place among the renowned ones that I have visited inside kathmandu They have now hiked their price We had mutton thali and veg thali Veg alone cost
Food and service is excellent Ambience is also pleasant There was no back up during power cut so the heat was difficult to tolerate
Cant beat their food So authentic Amazingly delicious I am definitely coming back
This place is a total waste of time and money I heard this was branch from Pokhara but the taste could not be replicated We could not ask for thap Khana because we felt the rice were added with some edibles sodas The rice grains were
Absolutely delicious and authentic Thakali food Really enjoyed the food here The chicken that came with the Thakali Khana set was just amazing I have been to a lot of Thakali restaurants and was always disappointed with the chicken and
Nepali food especially fish was good Staff w as efficient and courteous It was clean The place was packed during lunch Parking space was fairly large
Amazing food we ordered Thakali set mutton and veggie very delicious must try
Simon Says this is Perfect place to have a typical Nepali Thakali lunch delish saag veggies achar and rice Clean and spacious
Terrible food at super expensive price We went there for new year eve and order one chicken and one veg thakali khana set It was not even close to thakali food The rice was okay but each and every curry was too much salty and too much
I got surprise with an amazing taste of thakali set so good was memorable dinner in this place
i went with couple of my friends to have dinner here Soon the next day we had food poison My friends even need to stay at hospital due to the unbearable pain Please be careful while visiting the place
Hands down the best thakali Ive had in Nepal Whether it was in Kathmandu or Pokhara the food here does not disappoint A must try place for Thakali food
Missing the taste of authentic Thakali Khana Mantra Thakali could give a good break to it Since my favorite is Mutton I tried would give it out of
I went there for lunch and had Thakali Khana set I tried mutton set multiple times and it was always worth it Goto place while I am near Lalitpur both for food and craft beers
Visited times and the taste was too different From st visit I would recommend friends and family but from second visit I should say sorry
When you crave for DAALBHAATDHINDO Mantra never disappoints Keep up the maintenance of the quality of food service
Their food is really the best and the service is decent too But some of the staffs are inconsiderate and found making really loud noises
The food was amazingg The manager was really humble polite and sweet but the other staff kept banging the dishes It wad crowded but the food made it worthwhile
Food is good okay but price is not reasonable So stars
Food has amazing taste the staff and services are quick Overall the best experience Love to visit again
Best Thakali khana ever tried Price is a bit high Atmosphere is nice Staffs are well mannered
The mutton item is delicious In the night time its very busy
After long time here i am again Service is getting poor i guess
Khaana was good but a little overpriced Ample parking space for both two and four wheelers
Nice atmosphere and food Famous for its thali food I found a bit costly but worth it considering location
Good and hygienic food We tasted Chicken and Fish perfectly cooked with a typical Nepali taste
Hate the food Brother we have paid for the food to eat How can they serve quality graded meal pathetic Horrible Atinai Namitho had severe stomach ache after eating mantra thakali food momos yuck You eat momos oil drips from
We celebrated my sisters birthday and it was nice and cozy food was amazing
Quality and taste should be reconsidered mustang aalo chicken and spinach feels too much oily
They dont give you the VAT bill tax invoice unless you spend more than Seriously Even if i spend rs you are supposed to give me VAT bill if you are registered in VAT
The food was quite nice with a nice ambiance It definitely is a bit pricier than other thakali places
They serve with warmth and also explain dishes Good newari food
Absolutely satisfying taste and best customer service I would highly recommend to sort out some of your dinner plans here Friendly staffs specially Sanjok dangol was amazing with his customer service skills
I have a greater experience dining at Mantra with good food Thakali Khana Set and good service
One of if not the best Thakali food in Kathmandu Service and ambience were excellent A must if you are after authentic Thakali food
A go to place for a good experience of Thakali set Food is great and the hospitality of the staff there is second to none I really loved the taste there A must try place if youre nearby

One of the best thakali restaurant Loved it
Best of the best place and food
Saturday lunch time its pretty rushHad to wait about minutes I had ordered mutton thali The food is average I found gravy of mutton little salty so were the gravy of the chicken
Okayish food Also they dont provide curd to chicken thali i mean whats the logic behind it
Most of the foods where good in taste Chicken wings could have been better Thakali set is very good especially the aalu fry in the set Craft beers are good as well
Cant get over with the thakali khana Best thakali khana in town Ambience is also great Good food
Lot of masala in food I had acidity having mantra thakali food Didnt liked the food and very expensive
Food is awesome
Thakali khana set was good but chickenmutton was too spicy

Good place but they might confuse your order during rush hours
Food was not good for me Others must have enjoyed but it didnt have a good impression on me
Chicken thali set was pretty decent good portion was served However the service from the staff was poor and disappointing The table hadnt been cleaned and we didnt even get a glass of water or the menu until we asked for them ourselves Place was crowded on a Monday afternoon noisy ambience
Best thakali in Kathmandu valley The nepali thaalu you get here is the most delicious you can get anywhere Do not go without reserving tables if you got large group in rush and peak hours Esp Evening times and weekend evenings
This used to be my favourite thakali However I had a horrible experience today They forgot my order I asked the manager after the food didnt arrive There was no response so I had to ask another staff again Finally the manager came
Foods very testy and service is very good if you enter u will be served
Overhyped and underwhelming The food is nothing special and the atmosphere is too noisy and chaotic Nothing calm and cozy about it Also I get a stomachache everytime I eat there
Food was comparatively good but not authentic thakali like we used to have in Mustang
Nothing special food was average Chicken dumplings were filled with too much oil Service can be improved Overall i wont be returning again
Although it has ample parking space there is lacking about hospitality Ordered food for but one doesnt has all the food items on it Service satisfactory Cannot handle in rush hour

Amazing Thakali a must go place for nepali food
They have got varieties on their menu Nepali dishes We ate Khutti ko achar mutton thali and spent couple of hrs together
Maybe because the place was sooo busy at dinner hour their service couldnt meet my expectations but it was fair and good I went with a family of and their service attitude made me feel like they found it annoying to have huge group to
Came for Brunch for a lovely date with my partner and all the staffs were speaking rudely to us and disrespectfully We called the waiter to take our order and ignored us It was not even busy and the waitress were avoiding eye contact and
Fully Satisfied with Food
I waited for mins with my girlfriend but nobody even responded I had to shout for the menu and still they didnt even notice us The place isnt bad but you need to learn some hospitality and customer service while running such a restaurant Wouldnt recommend this to others
Went there for dinner Ordered chicken khana set Taste was good especially the chicken gravy was probably one of the best in the thakalis line However sightly disappointed due to
Found hair on the food but the staff were quick to replace the food
Its a very niece family restaurant in Lalitpur kathmandu city Although it was very busy and very crowded they will still accomodate and seats are still available They offer Pure Nepali Cuisine too
Food served Didnt even look for the menu just say which set you want to eat
Ambience of this place is nice But at the end of the day what really matters is food Nothing on that plate impressed me Even that papad looks sad What a waste of money
Food was too much oily and very expensive Almost NRs for chicken and veg thali
Food was really very good
Awesome food food
I have had tons of Thakali khana till the date but I can guarentee that this was literally one of the best that I ever had Service was extraordinary and ambience was superb
Improper Order management and veryyy mismanaged Waited for mins for chicken set still no signs of being served The staffs are not hospitable and wont care about the customers Also wayy more expensive than Jimbu and other competitors
I am very regular costumers of thakali cousins tested almost all of thakali restaurants in Kathmandu and Pokhara also But I cant meet my expectations in Thakali Khana set and dhedo set Mutton was worst and gravy is like a tomato
My wife and I had a dinner at this amazing restaurant We chose several dishes and the taste was absolutely delicious The staffs were truly friendly and attentive The manager was extremely polite helpful and friendly The customer service is exemplary and I recommend everyone to try the authentic Thakali cuisine
Gets pretty crowded on weekends Parking can be challenging Thakali set is amazing everything else on the menu is just ok Tried couple of appetizers they were kind of disappointing Thakali set is good though
Very vibrant and helpful staff members Love the way the manager treat you You will feel like home Food is good as well
Hands down the best thakali in town
Great ambience and food Do try the dhedobuckwheat for an authentic experience Sanjog the manager is very friendly and welcoming Suggests and helps you with food ordering Quite a lovely experience for us
Worst possible hospitality ever Dirty surrounding Rude staffs Manager is clueless Booked for people at pm Reached there at pm They had to table reserved Asked her to divide into two groups When complained the rude lady
Service is really fast and good with friendly staff
Best affordable place to have alcohol in jhamsikhel And the thakali set is amazing
Love the food here especially thakali khana however the place is very occupied most of the time But still they manage to deliver good quality food and has the place clean
They serve one of the best thaklai sets in town though especially the chicken sets The prices are above average in comparison to near thakali hubs But food wont disappoint you for the once in a while experience
Thakali khana here is one of the best in the town Daal bhat hr
Food was mediocre The manager seems to have an attitude of a pompous queen All other staffs seems pretty friendly and courteous Overall experience was ok And also it is not some kind of star restaurants or some Michellen rated high
One of the best place in valley to enjoy the delicious nepali cusine Proper Hospitality was provided Atmosphere over there seems so friendly and vibes was matching too Need to visit there more often with my family members
I called mantra thakali yesterday to reserve a dinner table for people one of whom was a business client from UK The guy on the phone was rude and abrupt He told me no reservation was required since there would be very few people at
All i want sayits amazinglove from uttarakhand INDIA
Everything here is spot on always would recommend for a thakali here
The reception at this place is absolutely terrible The service is really horrible and they dont even respond We waited for half an hour only to walk out and dined at Tukuche at the end I would not recommend this place to anyone If you have any selfrespect avoid this joke of a restaurant
Every non veg curry has Same Gravy
Love the thali set Highly recommended
Nice place for khana ample parking space and Pokhareli vibes
Tried the Pork Khana Set and Chicken Khana Set The rice was really good and all the sides tasted great The meat was not out of the world but the set tasted great
Went there for a family dinner We were in total Weve been there for so many times but we havent experienced such previously however on this day all of us had severe food poisoning diarrhea fever vomiting and extreme weakness
Best Thakali food in the valley Great environment and very welcoming staff Enjoyed the bhat by hath Clean bathroom Visiting there again

Good and delicious nepali food
Its a wonderful place to try Thakali I had a very good experience there Definitely try it
The food tasted good but among of us us got food poisoning and high fever Please make sure all ingredients are clean and of the best quality
I didnt know when me any my friend were craving for some Thakali we would be bed ridden for two days due to food poisoning The Mutton set I ordered was wayyyy too salty and the worse part is we didnt realize we were being served such
Hands down the best thakali food in townwe had chicken and mutton thali set with mutton sukuti gravy and mutton sukuti sadheko on the sideabsolutely deliciousthe rice is fluffy the dal is thickwas confused about the saag as its mixed with cabbage but delicious none the lesswould recommend

Nice superior manager is super friendly and fresher waitress Sabina also humble great experience
Ambience is good Nice service Excellent staff I will recommend this place to my friends and colleagues to spend good time for food
Its a family restaurant Not the best thakali but still better than jimbu
The atmosphere was pleasant Family couples and friends can dine in Interiors are superb
Went for dinner as we didnt got any spaces for lunch several time must say best place in Lalitpur for Thakali cuisine chicken fried in Nepali style and Pork acharr is must try
Very good foodneed to work on ambience and make it more comfortable for thakali food eaters may be open and or with space sitting arrangement round table
The food was average But considering how expensive it was I dont think this place would be of frequent visit
The ambiance of the restro was good but not the food The food was just costly not tasty I couldnt feel the nice vibe there
Expensive for the quality of food
Very average food Meat had no taste and oily Green veggies were cold Expensive for the food quality

Best thakali food in my opinion
Very tasty food at a cheap price compared to Europe Very friendly service and reception
The man sitting in the parking lot is so smart he cant tell if there is a place to eat rice from his house he came so late to eat but the food was so sweet that he came willingly
